                <![CDATA[Hmmmm, not sure how I found your site (facebook I guess?).  Anyways, I am learning Chinese too.  I&#039;m pettry far along, learning characters now.  Just a few recommendations from my own trial and error. 1. Rosetta stone is good, but NOT at the beginning.  The first thing to do is learn the tones and pin yin pronunciation.  A tutor or classroom setting would be best for this.  I used rosetta stone at first, and my pronunciation was terrible.  2. if you are learning characters, I love the book by Tuttle called  learning chinese charactors&#039;.  It uses the  science&#039; of memory, and gives you little stories and pictures to remember the characters. very useful!.  Have fun!
