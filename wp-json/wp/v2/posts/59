When I land, I often find myself in the midst of a new culture for a few days, on assignment as a filmmaker. What that translates to &#8211; or more accurately doesn&#8217;t translate to &#8211; is the need to be able to navigate and connect with people in a language that I&#8217;m not native in.<\/p>\n<p>One might argue that English is becoming the language of business everywhere. I kinda prefer to try to connect with people on their terms, or more accurately, in their own language.<\/p>\n<p>So what is someone from the midwest who has taken all of about two semesters of French and a smattering of Japanese classes to do?<\/p>\n<p>Surveying the options I&#8217;ve tried over the past several years:<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; cram for days before each trip and try to resemble a sponge&#8230;<br \/>\n&#8211; hire translators wherever I go (how do you say, &#8220;that&#8217;s not in the budget&#8221; in that language?)<br \/>\n&#8211; be a maniac with a phrasebook (note to self: improve charades skills&#8230;&#8230;)<br \/>\n&#8211; make friends with people around the world and have them be my personal translators (Gomen nasai (I&#8217;m sorry!), Shimizu-san!)<\/p>\n<p>We had an idea: what if there was something that would allow us to make someone laugh in their native language? Or to express gratitude in a way that was genuine and authentic to the area we were in? What if we had a global utility that was always there whenever we needed it &#8211; online or on our phones &#8211; that could answer the question, <strong>&#8220;How do I say ________ in any language?&#8221;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a big dream. One that we can&#8217;t hold by ourselves. We invite you to be part of something truly global and truly human &#8211; to help us create a community and utility that doesn&#8217;t exist yet: to be a part of Mightyverse. At the center of this is a bridge that we&#8217;ve been seeking between language and cultures &#8211; an enormous collection of native speaker video phrases that are cross-translated into other languages.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;re excited you&#8217;re here.<\/p>\n<p>For now, we invite you to browse through an early smattering of phrases (more than 20,000) that we&#8217;ve pulled together in over 20 languages. You&#8217;re bound to find holes &#8211; that&#8217;s part of the journey. Soon, you&#8217;ll be able to help us fill those in. If you have any thoughts or suggestions, we&#8217;d love to hear from you. And if you&#8217;re in the bay area and would like to get more involved, drop us a note &#8211; we&#8217;d love your help!<\/p>\n<p>Welcome to Mightyverse!
