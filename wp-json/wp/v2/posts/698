Mightyverse volunteers will assist recording at several  recording stations.  Each station will be equiped with a video camera, monitor, lighting, microphone and Mightyverse PhraseFarm teleprompter system to enable the capture of spoken language. These high quality recordings of native speakers will be made available at <a href=\"http:\/\/archive.org\/\">archive.org<\/a> under a Creative Commons license.<\/p>\n<p>Mightyverse is excited to support the <a href=\"http:\/\/longnow.org\/\">Long Now Foundation<\/a>&#8216;s 300 languages project in its <a href=\"http:\/\/rosettaproject.org\/record-a-thon\/\">July 30th 2011 record-a-thon<\/a>. The goal of the 300 languages project is to record spoken language that has parallel translations in at least 300 languages. Towards that effort, Laura Welcher and her team at <a href=\"http:\/\/rosettaproject.org\/\">The Rosetta Project<\/a> (an ongoing effort by The Long Now Foundation) have identified texts that already exist in parallel translations. Of those texts, we at Mightyverse were especially excited by the UDHR.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/blog.mightyverse.com\/blog-images\/microphone_72dpi_062111a.png\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) is the most translated document in the world and has <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ohchr.org\/EN\/UDHR\/Pages\/SearchByLang.aspx\">over 400 translations<\/a>. It was ratified by the United Nations in 1948. The UDHR was the first international recognition that all human beings have  fundamental rights and freedoms and it continues to be a relevant  document today over 60 years later. The UDHR continues to be a very important inspiration for millions of  people, and through our efforts with The Long Now Foundation, The Internet Archives and Mightyverse, our hope is to create a lasting  archive of language that extends the mission that was set forth over 60 years ago.<\/p>\n<p>We believe that language is the key to cultural understanding, our ability to create a peaceful  prosperous world and literally our survival as people on this planet. We are very excited to participate in this project.<\/p>\n<p>Please join us.  If you can be in SF, you can record with Mightyverse. If you are remote, you can submit recordings of the UDHR or other spoken language that you record on your own:<\/p>\n<div style=\"width:100%;text-align:left\">\n<div style=\"font-family:Helvetica, Arial;font-size:10px;padding:5px 0 5px;margin:2px;width:100%;text-align:left\"><a style=\"color:#ddd;text-decoration:none\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/r\/etckt\">Event registration<\/a><span style=\"color:#ddd\"> for <\/span><a style=\"color:#ddd;text-decoration:none\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/recordathon.eventbrite.com?ref=etckt\">RECORD-A-THON!<\/a><span style=\"color:#ddd\"> powered by <\/span><a style=\"color:#ddd;text-decoration:none\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.eventbrite.com?ref=etckt\">Eventbrite<\/a><\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>On July 30th, 2011 we will meet at the Internet Archive in San Francisco, where volunteers will record the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) in their native language(s).
