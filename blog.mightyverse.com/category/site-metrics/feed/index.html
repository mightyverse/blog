                <![CDATA[<p>Unsurprisingly, allowing people to browse Mightyverse phrase recordings around a theme increased website traffic.  When we released the Browse by Phrase List feature, we saw the average number of pages per visit go from just over 1 to almost 5.  We also saw an increase in tweets and Facebook links which drove an increase in unique visitors (shown in the graph below) around <a href="https://www.mightyverse.com/phrase_lists/hawaiian-greeting">Hawaiian</a> <a href="https://www.mightyverse.com/phrase_lists/hawaiian-vocabulary">phrase</a> lists, <a href="https://www.mightyverse.com/phrase_lists/first-hawaiian">first released</a> on April 9th and later around <a href="https://www.mightyverse.com/phrase_lists/navi-pickup-lines">Na&#8217;vi phrases</a> released on May 9th.</p>
<p>The overall numbers are still quite small, but it exciting to see a response to these specific workflow improvements, where our gut instincts for how we believe people will want to use the website are validated by quantitative metrics.</p>
