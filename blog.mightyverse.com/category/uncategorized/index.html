                            <p>Interpreting the words of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. into new languages allows us to
                                reflect more deeply on their meaning. The &#8220;I have a dream&#8221; speech is so well
                                known, and quickly evokes images of civil rights movement. White America has been
                                criticized for elevating Rev. Martin Luther King to an iconic status while selecting
                                speeches that feel safe, allowing us to focus on the dream as if we had achieved it,
                                when in fact, we are tragically far from creating the society that he envisioned.
                                Unfamiliar words challenge us to think about the meaning behind King&#8217;s words,
                                through the lens of other languages and culture.</p>
                            <p>This year, Paul and Glen stitched together our crowdsourced interpretations so you can
                                hear a portion of this famous speech in Spanish and French.</p>

                            <p>We hope that this exploration allows Dr. King’s historic “I Have a Dream” speech to take
                                on new dimensions for you. The effort of having people from around the world engage in
                                interpreting a speech that holds such deep and profound truths has expanded the impact
                                of its meaning for us. We invite you to explore and extend your connection to his words.

                            <p>Mightyverse is a <em>passion project</em> for all of us who work on it. I do mostly solo
                                coding on the website these days with occasional pair programming with friends from the
                                Ruby community. Most of the code for the iOS app is by John Fox, and we asynchronously
                                collaborate where I edit code and sometimes add features as I sharpen my iOS coding
                                skills. Developing something that is fun and really works for a community takes more
                                design than code, so most weekends Paul and I iterate on mock-ups, talk through use
                                cases and whenever possible connect with language learners who are willing to experiment
                                with our latest theories on social language learning.</p>
                            <p>In the talk I discuss some foundational research about fun and learning, and approaches
                                to game design. One idea from game design that is very relevant to Mighytverse is the
                                concept of the &#8220;epic win.&#8221; The epic win is an extraordinary outcome that you
                                didn’t believe was even possible until you achieved it (via <a
                                    href="https://www.ted.com/talks/jane_mcgonigal_gaming_can_make_a_better_world">Jane
                                    McGonigal</a>). </p>
                            <p>Mightyverse seeks an epic win on two levels. There is the epic win for an individual who
                                becomes fluent in a new language. Being able to speak another language is like having a
                                super power &#8212; you can reach people, experience other cultures and make things
                                happen that you could not otherwise do. </p>
                            <p>Also, Mightyverse, as a company, seeks to save the world&#8217;s endangered languages.
                                There are over 6000 languages in the world. The majority of them are spoken by a tiny
                                fraction of the population, and <a
                                    href="http://www.ultrasaurus.com/2009/02/who-cares-if-languages-become-extinct/">almost
                                    80% of us, speak only 83 languages</a>. Almost 50% of the world&#8217;s languages
                                are endangered and one goes extinct every 2-3 weeks. Our epic win would be to create a
                                system that would be sustained (and paid for) by people learning the &#8220;big&#8221;
                                languages, which would always be free for endangered languages, providing tools that
                                help people connect with their heritage, teaching and learning through social
                                connections. We believe that diversity of language enriches our world.</p>

                                    English with multiple voices</a>. With the help of various friends, we created
                                Spanish subtitles for the speech. On Jan 20, 2013, President Obama&#8217;s second
                                inauguration day, I <a

                                    about sharing this part of American culture</a> with English language learners. I
                                was optimistic about race relations in America, yet felt that this speech helped us
                                remember our past and share that painful reality with people learning about our country.

                                    target="_blank">I have a Dream in Spanish</a>, we captured voices from all over the
                                world, crowdsourcing interpretations as well as recordings from old and new friends.</p>
                            <p>The interpretation of these words into another language causes me to hear the meaning in
                                a fresh and powerful way. We didn&#8217;t use professional translators, but allowed the
                                people recording the phrases to interpret them in their own words. Our friends M. E.
                                Stevens, Tania Waisberg, and Enric Godes suggested some of the more poetic
                                interpretations. Many thanks to everyone who participated (especially Enric and Bruno
                                for organizing the artist voices at <a href="http://www.vasava.es/"
                                    target="_blank">Vasava</a>!).</p>
                            <p>This speech has become almost cliché in English, but when I hear it in new Spanish words,
                                I hear the meaning reverberate in my mind with news from the past year. I hope that this
                                project helps Americans who understand Spanish to reflect on our heritage, and that
                                Spanish learners will be inspired to speak difficult truths.</p>

                                card games when they could be writing software?” or “Have they pivoted to become a board
                                game company?&#8221; Good questions, that we&#8217;ve wrestled with ourselves. The
                                answer lies in the fundamental goals of our company and our <em>lean startup</em>
                                approach. The origin of the card game was a <a

                            <p>To learn to speak a language, we must actually speak the language. &nbsp;But how do you
                                speak the language if you don’t already know it? Language learning research supports
                                that people learn best in an immersive language learning environment, learning grammar
                                and vocabulary by inferring patterns from the language we hear. &nbsp;One of the biggest
                                hurdles that we face as new language learners is to be brave enough to start speaking
                                when we know very little and may feel uncertain about the true meaning of the words we
                                speak. This is a huge barrier for most new language learners to overcome. ¡Dígame! came
                                out of wrestling with that challenge for language learning gameplay. We realized that we
                                could accomplish rapid iterations of the card game much faster than software and that
                                would speed up our design process. Over the past year, we have held dozens of play test
                                sessions with groups of friends, strangers, classrooms and families at all levels of
                                learning, from near-fluent to people with no prior knowledge of the language.</p>
                            <p>Our overall goals for the games include:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>validating the Mightyverse language learning model</li>
                                <li>understanding what&#8217;s needed to make language learning fun</li>
                                <li>developing a community of early adopters</li>
                                <li>driving awareness of the Mightyverse brand among teachers and language enthusiasts
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>We designed the game to reflect the language learning model that we believe is the most
                                powerful and efficient way to learn a language. Each of the phrase cards in the game is
                                linked to a Mightyverse phrase video with a QR code. We have analytics in place to see
                                how and where those phrases are accessed.</p>
                            <p>With the first game complete after a considerable effort, it will be much simpler to
                                create variations across different language pairings. We have InDesign templates with
                                scripts to automate creation of the playing cards so that the production of the game can
                                be scaled more easily across other languages.</p>
                            <p>We are quite far along on a Japanese learning game for English speakers and an English
                                learning game for Japanese speakers that we have already started play testing.
                                We&#8217;re also hard at work building our mobile app that allows native speakers to
                                record phrases and share them with language learners. It is exciting to feel how our
                                momentum has increased with everything we have learned over the past year, working with
                                our growing community of speakers and learners.</p>
                            <p>We&#8217;ve had a lot of fun developing the game from it&#8217;s initial sketches to a
                                full fledged product. It&#8217;s been extremely gratifying to see how much fun people
                                have with it while learning languages.</p>

                            <p>Last Thursday, we held a Game Night where we beta tested a complete version of our

                            <p>It was held at the <a href="https://ninefold.com/">Ninefold</a> San Francisco office, who

                            <p>It was great fun. Here are a few photos from the group who played with the

                                able to print a run of 250 cards. If we can print 1000 the cost goes down significantly,

                                word out, we want you to be part of our outreach team! And, of course, EVERYONE who is
                                part of the team, gets a free deck. </p>

                            <p>One of the most exciting parts of learning a language is when you can actually
                                communicate with someone else in that language. When you first start learning it can
                                feel like a chicken-and-egg problem – you need to speak in order to learn to speak. Some
                                people spend years in language classes, before they feel like they have enough
                                vocabulary and grasp of the language to hold a conversation. However, time and again, we
                                hear stories of people who successful interact with people in their new language within
                                weeks (or even days!) of starting to learn.</p>
                            <p>Benny the Irish Polyglot suggests “You are always ready to speak a language, no matter
                                what level you are at” and has some great <a
                                    href="http://www.fluentin3months.com/how-to-make-the-transition-from-typical-english-speaking-tourist-to-local-language-speaking-expat/">tips
                                    for getting started</a>.</p>
                            <p>The secret is to just dive in, and we’ve encoded some simple tricks in our <a
                                    href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/digame-an-immersive-spanish-language-learning-game/x/1925896">¡Dígame¡
                                    language game</a> that make that easier. You don’t have to even use our game to get
                                started.</p>
                            <p>We’ve identified 7 phrases that can help you get your meaning across when you have very
                                little vocabulary. You can practice with a language partner before you try with a
                                stranger. In the game, we use these to help players communicate. The neat thing about
                                these phrases, is that each has a corresponding gesture that usually works if you forget
                                the phrase. When you practice using these gestures and simple phrases, you get better at
                                making yourself understood and understanding others when you have very few words.</p>

                            <h2>Understanding What You Heard</h2>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Repite, por favor</strong> (please repeat) or <strong>Otra vez</strong>
                                    (again / another time) This is essential when you ear is new to the language and you
                                    want to hear something again. Rotating your hand in a circle will help your listener
                                    understand what you mean even if you don&#8217;t quite pronoun the phrases
                                    correctly, though English-speakers will have a fairly easy time remembering
                                    &#8220;repite&#8221;</li>
                                <li><strong>¿Qué significa?</strong> (what does that mean?) You can use the same gesture
                                    as &#8220;Yo no sé&#8221; putting both hands palm up to invite someone to use
                                    different words or gestures to explain what they just told you. If you repeat the
                                    phrase or word that you don&#8217;t understand, then the other person can help you
                                    distinguish between not hearing correctly or not understanding.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h2>Clarifying Meaning</h2>
                            <p>These are three essential clarification words and phrases. You can start with
                                &#8220;sí&#8221; and &#8220;no,&#8221; but if you can use the longer versions, it will
                                be a little less abrupt and will feel more like a conversation.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Sí</strong> (yes) or <strong>Asi es</strong> (that&#8217;s it) &#8212; You
                                    can use the ok sign forming a circle with your thumb and forefinger with your other
                                    fingers spread upward. Thumbs up also works well.</li>
                                <li><strong>casi</strong> (almost) &#8212; this is really important, often you need to
                                    get them to say more to explain when you know that it&#8217;s not quite no or yes
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>No</strong> or <strong>Asi no es</strong> (that&#8217;s not it) &#8212; with
                                    your hand palm down, move it back and forth. This gesture is more polite than the
                                    thumbs down gesture, and will be understood by most Spanish speakers.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h2>Getting it</h2>
                            <p>It is important to be able affirm when you understand or that you still need help.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Yo lo sé</strong> (I know it) or <strong>Entiendo</strong> (I understand)
                                    &#8212; clapping your hands together with delight can be a rewarding affirmation for
                                    your language partner who has helped you.</li>
                                <li><strong>Yo no sé. ¿Qué es?</strong> (I don&#8217;t know. What is it?) &#8212; not
                                    strictly necessary if you know the other phrases, but some variety can really help
                                    move the conversation along.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>I love learning languages. I love that spark of understanding when I get my point across
                                in a new language. I love how my brain settles into unfamiliar patterns as I discover
                                how to say something in a language different from my own. I even love the silly mistakes
                                early on, when I’m brave enough to speak and someone else is not afraid to correct me.
                                I’ve puzzled at the contradiction of how I can love learning a language, yet it still
                                requires great discipline.</p>
                            <p>With Mightyverse, we wanted to capture that simple joy of mastery and make it easier to
                                get to those good feelings more often. We set out to design a mobile, social experience
                                that would make it so we actually want to practice vocabulary, since it feels like
                                playing a game, rather than feeling like homework.</p>

                            <p>After some <a href="/2014/03/game-design-and-gamification/">gamification research</a>, we
                                designed our mobile software game, then before building it or creating a detailed visual
                                design, we set out to create a “paper prototype.” This is a common software design
                                practice where we actually construct the experience with drawings on paper and get
                                people to look at and interact with a series of sketches, making it easy to get quick
                                feedback on layout, wording, and a sequence of interactions. For our game, which relies
                                heavily on the crowdsourced video phrases in Mightyverse, we realized we could
                                substitute a native or fluent speaker of the language to create a real-world experience
                                that mimics an online experience of interacting with our global language community.</p>
                            <p>We decided that we would not write a line of code until we could create a situation with
                                our game where a group of people in real life had fun learning and speaking their
                                learning language. We didn’t just want to add sparkles and unicorns to make it
                                entertaining, we wanted to tap into the aspects of social learning that we believe will
                                make the mobile game intrinsically fun.</p>
                            <p>Through several design iterations, we actually created two separate card games. The
                                second one was much easier to play test since it required only one speaker of the
                                learning language. We created the card game in three languages (Spanish, English and
                                Japanese) with hand-written phrases and printouts pasted on index cards. We then went to
                                the fabulous <a title="SF Babel" href="http://www.meetup.com/SFBabel/"
                                    target="_blank">SFBabel Meetup</a>, and asked random groups of strangers to play our
                                game. It was exciting to see people having fun playing the game and we learned so much
                                from their responses.</p>
                            <p>For our next iteration, with my friend Val, some kids and friends, we printed out our
                                “helper” cards with instructions that were way too long and a little
                                confusing&#8230;<br />

                                But once we started playing, it was fun. It was amazing to see the transition from bored
                                skepticism to laughter and playful banter in Spanish! We played for hours, with longer
                                and longer stretches where everyone only spoke Spanish.<br />

                            <p>After many more sessions of playing the game, iterating on the rules and the cards, we
                                have a system that really works. People have fun speaking Spanish, whether they start
                                with little confidence and very few words or many years of Spanish classes.</p>

                                when there is no fluent speaker present using a mobile app, integrating our crowdsourced

                            <p>As we set out to design the next phase of Mightyverse development, we want to add
                                elements of gameplay.  We believe that, for many people, learning to speak a language is
                                intrinsically fun; however even for those people, it can also require tremendous
                                discipline, which is not fun.  We asked ourselves&#8230; could we make a game that
                                applies what we know from our research on effective language learning as well as what we
                                hear from Mightyverse users to make it so all aspects of language learning are fun?</p>
                            <p>To get our whole team up to speed on the latest gamification ideas and best practices, we
                                watched a series of videos.  For other software developers, our future team members, and
                                our visitors who are just curious about what we&#8217;re up to, I&#8217;m posting the
                                links and some notes.</p>

                            <p>The talk is really only 32 minutes, so don&#8217;t be freaked out by the length on
                                YouTube (Q&amp;A was not particularly insightful from my perspective, so you could skip
                                that part)</p>
                            <p>I enjoyed the talk. For me it was a great review of game design principals (which are
                                mostly applicable to design in general), and neat to think about the analogy of board
                                game design to software design. Also, it provides a great framework for thinking about
                                how to prototype a software game as a physical game.</p>
                            <p>One key point that I hadn&#8217;t ever heard expressed so well was about the importance
                                of having a clear mental model. </p>

                                &#8211; Keep it simple<br />
                                &#8211; Keep it raw<br />

                                &#8211; Iterate, but have a clear goal.</p>
                            <p>&#8211; Make it accessible. Reduce Friction. &#8220;You can&#8217;t have a great game, if
                                people can&#8217;t play it&#8221;<br />
                                &#8211; Embody the players: :Make it feel like you are <em>in</em> the
                                game.&#8221;<br />

                                <p>Fun from games arises out of mastery. It arises out of comprehension. It is the act
                                    of solving puzzles that makes games fun. &#8212; Raph Koster, A Theory of Fun
