					<description><![CDATA[Japanese was supposedly my fogerin language, which I haven&#039;t touched since I graduated from college. A trip to Japan would be a good incentive to brush up the language.Chinese... (you know the story...)Took Latin for two years in high school as a tool to help learn the roots of vocabulary. Continued for three more years in college. I don&#039;t consider it as a fogerin language because people don&#039;t really speak it. It&#039;s more of a written language that lays the ground for other Romantic languages.
