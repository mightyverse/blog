					<description><![CDATA[Until it is formally adopted by SIL, it would be premature to change it to anything.  I do think &quot;nvi&quot; is a likely candidate but in the end it is up to SIL to determine what will be assigned.  However it would be ISO 639-3 ONLY.  ISO 639-2 is maintained by the Library of Congress and has a higher requirement for acceptance, namely it must have a more significant body of published work (50 total within up to 5 different institutions).  And of course it must be an ISO 639-3 language before it can be accepted in ISO 639-2.  If Na&#039;vi ever meets that higher standard, it would not be for awhile.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Nice background Omängum! Thank you. Since we are making a guess right now, and Nav is already taken by Navaho, do you think we should propose NVI and then edit the Wiktionary entry to match, citing Mightyverse as a precedent?

If so, would the codes be more like these?:
ISO 639-1:  n/a
ISO 639-2:  nvi
ISO 639-3: nvi
RFC3066  : art-nvi]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My understanding of the process for adopting ISO 639-3 codes, the pending applications get reviewed and adopted or rejected once a year at the beginning of the year.  Prior to that they are put up for a review period of 3 months for people to submit comments.  So the basic result is a request to include a language must be submitted by October to be considered for the coming review.  It seems nobody working on Avatar thought to do that, and the language didn&#039;t really get publicity until November/December.  So perhaps even if it had been submitted, it might have been rejected at that point, due to having almost no public material, despite the goal of SIL to have a comprehensive list of languages.

Looking through the history of ISO 639-3 requests, there are very few constructed languages represented, and most of them are aux languages like Esperanto or research languages.  The only purely fictional/entertainment languages included are Klingon, Tolkein&#039;s Quenyan and Sindarin, and Láadan.  The request form is quite accommodating to constructed languages, so it seems more to be a lacking of conlangers knowing about the process, believing there language is notable enough to go through the process, or even considering it worth it to bother.  Perhaps a combination.

Na&#039;vi is no exception.  At this point, to my knowledge, nobody has submitted a request to create a new code for Na&#039;vi.  However, as Spring turns to Summer and Paul Frommer finishes with the last of the semesters responsibilities for teaching, that may change.]]></description>
