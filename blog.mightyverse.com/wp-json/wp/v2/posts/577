For example, most scholars agree that spoken Cantonese and Mandarin are different languages, even though they share identical Chinese writing. However, Cantonese is often referred to as a dialect of Mandarin.  Are the 71M Cantonese speakers, the majority of whom also speak Mandarin, multilingual?  I believe so, but I don&#8217;t think they were included by the sources used for my analysis above.<\/p>\n<p>I was conservative in my analysis, so I do think it is possible that a majority of the world speaks more than one language; however, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gizmag.com\/go\/7334\/\">almost half of the world&#8217;s population still lives in rural areas<\/a> where people are often monolingual, although in China, everyone learns Mandarin, in addition to their local language.  Everyone agrees that multilingualism is increasing, but I haven&#8217;t seen reports with credible numbers that quantify the trend.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>Based on research in the 1990&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.andaman.org\/author\/author.htm\">George Weber<\/a> of the Andaman Association wrote an interesting article on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.andaman.org\/BOOK\/reprints\/weber\/rep-weber.htm\">the world&#8217;s most influential languages<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>I found it quite interesting to see the number of secondary speakers, with the largest being french (although there are plenty of folk on the web who argue with his assessment).<br \/>\n<img class=\"alignnone\" title=\"Secondary speakers are people who speak one or more languages in addition to their first (home, mother or primary) language.\" src=\"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20130120032327\/http:\/\/andaman.org\/BOOK\/reprints\/weber\/Weber-TopTen6.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\n<p>It is notable that the margin of error in looking at the number of  speakers is quite large, and this study seems to have taken the lowest of each estimate .\u00a0 According to a <a href=\"http:\/\/webcache.googleusercontent.com\/search?q=cache:6TvgJUAV2kkJ:www2.ignatius.edu\/faculty\/turner\/languages.htm+Summer+Institute+for+Linguistics+%28SIL%29+1999+Ethnologue+Survey&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us&amp;client=firefox-a\">summary by M.
