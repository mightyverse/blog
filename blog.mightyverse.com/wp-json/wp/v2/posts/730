Despite years of French, my most passable second language is Spanish (which I speak like a not very intelligent 2 year old). Regardless, little snippets of languages I&#8217;ve picked up over the years have been so important to me. Saying &#8220;itadakimas&#8221; before eating, or &#8220;hi!&#8221; when you want to emphatically agree with someone as they speak has become woven into my vernacular.<\/p>\n<p>Wouldn&#8217;t it be wonderful if we could all share each other&#8217;s poignant, wise, deeply felt expressions and take them into our own communications as we move through life?<\/p>\n<p>This has been a driving force behind Mightyverse.<\/p>\n<p>Imagine being able to say, &#8220;Wow, that&#8217;s extraordinary, thank you!&#8221; or &#8220;I love cheese!&#8221; in all 7000+ languages spoken today.<\/p>\n<p>With community based language recording efforts by the Rosetta Project, Internet Archives (and in our small contribution, Mightyverse) that has some chance of becoming possible.<\/p>\n<p>We can&#8217;t think of better partners in the social mission side of Mightyverse than The Rosetta Project and The Internet Archives. The Record-a-thon tomorrow is going to be a really fun start to that collaboration.<\/p>\n<p>Many thanks to the event sponsors, organizers and supporters, including <a href=\"http:\/\/longnow.org\/people\/staff\/laura\/\">Dr. Laura Welcher of The Rosetta Project<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/about\/about.php\">Brewster Kahle, founder of The Internet Archives<\/a>, and <a href=\"http:\/\/elizabethlindsey.com\/wordpress\/about\/\">Elizabeth Lindsey, keynote speaker<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Stay tuned to see the recordings post event!<\/p>\n<p>-Paul<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A great article about our upcoming Record-a-thon event just came out in the New York Times this morning.<br \/>\nHere&#8217;s the link:<br \/>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2011\/07\/29\/us\/29bcculture.html\">A Chance to Record Some of the 112 Local Languages<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":83,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[7,8,11],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/blog.mightyverse.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/730"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/blog.mightyverse.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/blog.mightyverse.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/blog.mightyverse.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/83"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/blog.mightyverse.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=730"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/blog.mightyverse.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/730\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/blog.mightyverse.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=730"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/blog.mightyverse.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=730"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/blog.mightyverse.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=730"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
