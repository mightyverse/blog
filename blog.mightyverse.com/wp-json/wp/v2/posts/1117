Even if that person had to learn from the English translation in the video, the rest of the group learned through the immersive quality of the game, decoding meaning by watching and using their own gestures while only hearing and saying the phrase in Spanish.<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Mightyverse Game Learn Spanish or Japanese!\" width=\"625\" height=\"352\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/ZIrp8xQscJI?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>The feature of QR codes linked to expressive videos on the phrase cards has been a big success so far and adds a fun dimension to the game.
