That may well be, but during Goethe&#8217;s lifetime those in the know were of a rather different opinion.  In 1819, the fairy-tale compiler and linguist Jacob Grimm compared the langauge of his day to that of previous centuries, and lamented that &#8220;six hundred years ago, every common peasant knew &#8211;that is to say practised daily &#8212; perfections and niceties of the German language of which the best language-teachers nowadays can no longer even dream.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The thesis of the book is that this it is precisely this destruction of language where the mystery of language creation lies &#8212; &#8220;all languages change, all the time &#8212; the only static languages are dead ones.&#8221; (p.55)<\/p>\n<p>We don&#8217;t have to wait generations to hear the how languages change.  It can be witnessed by traveling to different parts of a country or, more dramatically, by listening for differences in dialects of a single language across multiple countries.<\/p>\n<p>I highly recommend <a href=\"http:\/\/www.unfoldingoflanguage.com\/\">the book<\/a> which is a little academic at times, but full of fascinating historical and modern references that illustrate how languages evolve.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&#8220;The english of today is not what it used to be, but then again, it never was,&#8221; writes Guy Deutscher in The Unfolding of Language.
