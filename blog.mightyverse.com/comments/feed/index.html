                <![CDATA[I would say that an important demographic missed out here would be the number of people living in countries made through colonisation. In Paraguay, for example, about 85% of the country speak both Spanish and the indigenous language of Guaraní. This is exceptional in the region, but there are still a significant population who speak indigenous mother tongues and then Spanish or Portuguese (Quechua, the most spoken with about 9 million, itself comes from being the Incan language, where it quite possibly was once a lingua franca). Then there&#039;s Hindi in India, Urdu in Pakistan, multilingualism in Afghanistan, Swahili in Uganda, DRC etc. So maybe it&#039;s all these that bring up the total to past 50%?

                <![CDATA[Hmmmm, not sure how I found your site (facebook I guess?).  Anyways, I am learning Chinese too.  I&#039;m pettry far along, learning characters now.  Just a few recommendations from my own trial and error. 1. Rosetta stone is good, but NOT at the beginning.  The first thing to do is learn the tones and pin yin pronunciation.  A tutor or classroom setting would be best for this.  I used rosetta stone at first, and my pronunciation was terrible.  2. if you are learning characters, I love the book by Tuttle called  learning chinese charactors&#039;.  It uses the  science&#039; of memory, and gives you little stories and pictures to remember the characters. very useful!.  Have fun!

                <![CDATA[Japanese was supposedly my fogerin language, which I haven&#039;t touched since I graduated from college. A trip to Japan would be a good incentive to brush up the language.Chinese... (you know the story...)Took Latin for two years in high school as a tool to help learn the roots of vocabulary. Continued for three more years in college. I don&#039;t consider it as a fogerin language because people don&#039;t really speak it. It&#039;s more of a written language that lays the ground for other Romantic languages.

                <![CDATA[Hi Sarah, and thanks for your comment! Yes, apparently this might well be true... but I have been trying to get my head around this for a while in terms of how can one know…

Still, none of the sources mentioned here says much else than that &quot;it so”… Im afraid the Center for Applied Linguistics that you linked doesn’t  report on what you quoted, but a Tucker, G. Richard does –though without any sources. Your second and third links takes me to what it looks like a Japanese cell phone shop… Oh well. Thanks anyway! (the closest thing I&#039;ve found is about Europe, and yes, half of them do speak a 2nd language  http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_386_en.pdf )
