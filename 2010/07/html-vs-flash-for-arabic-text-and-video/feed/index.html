                <![CDATA[We have improved Arabic support in Flash Player 10. If you are using a text component based on the new Flash Text Engine or the Text Layout Framework (either from Flex 4 or Flash CS5) your Arabic phrase should render correctly. Or you can use FTE or TLF directly in actionscript. Please come to our forums to discuss how you&#039;re generating captions so we can help.

                <![CDATA[Hey Sarah:

With modern browsers (i.e. FF/Safari 3+ and IE 7+ you should be able to overlay HTML DOM elements on top of Flash. I do this in the prototype MemoryMiner for Web application which uses Flash for the image pan &#038; zoom layer, and HTML DOM elements (including Canvas/SVG depending on the browser) for the selection markers, text overlays, buttons, etc.

http://stepinside.memoryminer.com

Don&#039;t know if there&#039;s anything special that happens when the Flash player is displaying video that would cause trouble, but things might not be so bleak, unless of course you insist on trying to support ancient browsers.

Best,

John]]>

                <![CDATA[Hi Sarah, I don&#039;t read either, and so am unsure of what the error is, nor how it was introduced.

Are you doing some type of live read of external text to do the display? (Assuming so, since you seem to have identical text available in HTML.) If so, do you know which text options it uses, and which type of errors you&#039;d like to correct?
