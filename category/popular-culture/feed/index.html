<p dir="ltr">I’ve been interested in hyperglots for awhile, especially as they relate to accelerating language learning. Do hyperglots have some extra cognitive capacity to hold all of that language in their brains, a capacity that us regular mortals don’t? Are there techniques we can learn from them that can be broadly applied in our own efforts?</p>
<p dir="ltr">There are rockstar hyperglots on the web like <a href="http://youtu.be/FOiXtWcQ8GI">Timothy Doner</a>, <a href="http://youtu.be/yNYMsazFx8w">Lindie Botes</a> and <a href="http://youtu.be/6HZbBLl4FA0">Benny the Hyperglot</a>. Their appeal is immediate when you see them speaking in videos on YouTube, promising that humans are capable of much more language diversity than we commonly encounter.</p>
<p dir="ltr">While doing user research at language meetups for Mightyverse, I met a woman named Diana Gruber speaking with another person in flawless Spanish. When we introduced each other, her English was flawless as well, and later in the conversation I learned that also speaks French, Italian and Portuguese at a near native level, as well as quite passable German. <a href="http://www.hablahouston.com/houston-spanish-school-instructors.html">She also taught at a language school in Texas </a>and has her own ideas on the best way to start to learn a language and then polish your skills over time. One of her key ideas is that it’s important to gain an effect with your new language as soon as you can, learning phrases that you can put to immediate use (“Un cerveza por favor!” and the like).</p>
<p dir="ltr">I invited Diana to our studio where she graciously consented to a video interview about being a hyperglot (an interview that I hope to link to in a future post). She also recorded a series of <a href="https://www.mightyverse.com/en/phrase_lists/medical-spanish-phrases-part-1">Spanish Medical Phrases</a> for Mightyverse.</p>
<p>While we had the camera set up and were on a roll,  we recorded Diana <a href="http://youtu.be/w1Fmbv6eThA">speaking in six languages</a> and it took off on YouTube the day she posted it.</p>

<p>We recently embarked on a project to record <a href="https://www.mightyverse.com/phrase_lists/navi-vocabulary">Na&#8217;vi phrases</a> into Mightyverse. Na&#8217;vi is a constructed language created by <a href="http://www.undispatch.com/node/9809">James Cameron</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Frommer">Dr. Paul Frommer</a> for the movie Avatar. Due to the popularity of the movie, it&#8217;s estimated that Na&#8217;vi is already the fourth most popular constructed language, after Esperanto, Klingon and Elvish (from the Lord of the Rings).</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been fascinated by the community that&#8217;s sprung up around <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=121350582">Na&#8217;vi</a> and the people who are learning it. It has the potential to become a relatively popular language, with events where people communicate solely in Na&#8217;vi, teaching it to their children and translating texts like Shakespeare and the Bible. In the face of the decimation of indigenous languages worldwide, friends of mine who are following Mightyverse have questioned why we would spend anytime documenting <a href="http://gawker.com/5488916/real-navi-of-india-beg-james-cameron-to-save-their-tribe">Na&#8217;vi</a> while so many worthy, incredibly vital languages need to be recorded.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a fair and thoughtful question.</p>
<p>My own feelings about the movie are complicated. I thought it was ultimately a violent revenge fantasy cloaked in a peaceful message film. Kind of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dances_with_Wolves">Dances with Wolves</a> all over again, with a weird Pocahontas story woven in. I&#8217;m not a big fan of the film and felt kind of yucky after seeing it. <a href="http://www.criterion.com/boxsets/722-by-brakhage-an-anthology-volumes-one-and-two">But I like weird stuff and I&#8217;m clearly not the intended audience for the film anyway</a>. I have to confess though that I was absolutely entranced by the craft of the film and the exquisite production that it represents. Cameron has no equal in the universal spectacle of Hollywood film. And his work has now spread across the globe to places more refined stories will never reach. It&#8217;s a true phenomena of human storytelling writ large.</p>
<p>So, here are the reasons why I felt Na&#8217;vi recordings could be important for the evolution of Mightyverse.</p>
<p>&#8211; Na&#8217;vi is international. I love the fact that people all over the world are learning Na&#8217;vi and in the process sharing a love of language across cultural borders.<br />
&#8211; Na&#8217;vi learners are obsessed. It&#8217;s amazing how many <a href="http://www.learnnavi.org/">incredible resources</a> have been produced so quickly, and how <a href="http://forum.learnnavi.org/">they are evolving daily</a>. They&#8217;ve escaped beyond the confines of the film and are now creating their own world far more interesting than the limits of Pandora.<br />
&#8211; Na&#8217;vi excites children about language and other cultures. Children are the key to the future of language survival. If they learn about <a href="http://www.learnnavi.org/navi-grammar/">adpositions, topical, dative and genitive cases</a> through Na&#8217;vi, well that can&#8217;t be too harmful.</p>
<p>Finally, if people learn about Mightyverse through a link somewhere to Na&#8217;vi phrases, well, that would be very nice as well.</p>
